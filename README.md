# CS255-Portfolio-Project
Portfolio submission for CS 255. Includes the Business Requirements Document and System Design Document for the DriverPass project.
Project Summary
The DriverPass project was created for a client that provides online driver's education and behind-the-wheel training. They needed a system to help students register for courses, schedule driving lessons, track progress, and handle payments, while allowing administrators and instructors to manage operations efficiently.

Reflection
What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well gathering the customer's needs and translating them into clear, actionable business requirements. I also organized the document in a logical structure that was easy to understand.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the technical requirements section by providing more specific details around system performance, such as expected load times and security measures.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I carefully reviewed the client interview and identified the key needs: ease of use for students, flexibility in scheduling, and efficient tracking of student progress. Addressing these needs is critical to ensure the system is user-friendly and supports the client’s business goals.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design by first gathering detailed requirements, then creating clear models like use case diagrams to visualize system interactions. In the future, I would also create early prototypes or mockups to validate user experience before finalizing the design.
